# Foreword
First of all, I would like to express a warm welcome, may this document inform and enlighten you.

This report will be about the C++ programming language and is a part of the ICP "Introduction to Programming Language Concepts"  course at the University of Applied sciences Leiden.

This foreword will be written after the conclusion of the report and will provide a small summary of the information.

Without further ado, let's start reading! The next chapter will tell you all you need to know about the history of the c++ programming language.

# History of c++
In the pioneering days of computer programming (the 1950's). Programmers had to write their code to interact directly with the hardware of the computer. They wrote instructions directly to the memory and would use the basic bits and bytes to define and convey data.

During this period, programmers started building languages that were easier to understand for humans working in specific areas. For example, FORTRAN was built for engineers and scientists and COBALT was built for businessmen.

## The SIMULA programming language
Around the 1960s the idea started to grow about languages that were easier to understand for humans and useful across all domains. One of these languages was SIMULA. The Simula programming language is considered the first object-oriented programming language. It was primarily designed for simulations where classes would represent a concept in your application world. For example, a customer record or a hotel reservation would have its own class.

## The C programming language
From 1969 until 1972, the C programming language was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C was developed to provide a high-level abstraction layer that could be compiled into assembler language while still retaining a lot of access to the hardware. The advantage of this was that the code became "portable", this means that C code can run on any processor architecture as long as there was a compiler available for it. The UNIX operating system was (re)written in C and is still massively popular because so many kinds of computer systems provide a C compiler.

## C with classes
In 1979 a Danish computer scientist by the name of Bjarne Stroustrup began to work on "C with classes". Bjarne took the object-oriented abstraction layer ideas of the SIMULA programming language and combined it with the low-level capabilities of the C programming language. Bjarne later renamed "C with classes" to C++. In essence, the C++ programming language combines the C programming language with the Object-Oriented abstraction layer of the SIMULA programming language.

C++ is still a massively popular programming language because it provides the ability to have efficient Object-Oriented abstractions without sacrificing hardware access, which is very useful for many use cases such as: Operating Systems, microcontrollers and embedded systems. Another factor in its popularity is that C++ has compilers for all popular processor architectures, in fact, I think it is hard to find a processor architecture that does not have a C++ compiler. You can be pretty sure that if your C++ code is up to standard, it will run basically anywhere without extensive adjustments to the code.
